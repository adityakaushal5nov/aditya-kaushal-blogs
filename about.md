Hi, I am Aditya Kaushal, a Computer Science Engineering Graduate. I am working as a Salesforce Developer at Mirketa Softwares. Being a Certified Platform Developer-1, I enjoy designing, programming large CRM Applications that fast, reliable and scalable. 

I love thinking of real life problems as puzzles and try to find an algorithmic approach. Automata Theory, Data Structures, Design and Analysis of Algoithms and computer architecture occupy most of imagination. 

I am still baffled whether P = NP?, Alan Turing, Grace Hopper, Denise Richie, Linus Tovards are legends whose work is always undermentioned

You can find some of my open source projects at GitHub:
